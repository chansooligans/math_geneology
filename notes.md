- Broadly, what are some impactful things we can learn from this dataset?
	- Value of Connectivity: how much does network connectivity influence citations?
	- Most Influential: Rubin is the "godfather" of "causal inference"... can we see this in the network? Are there others like him? 
	- Diversity: Do diverse networks (gender, ethnicity, country, or school-attended for dissertation) "perform" better? 
	- Discrimination: are there any differences in network patterns between people of different races, genders, etc? 
	- Knowledge Transfers: Identify authors of some of the most important papers. Are there unique characteristics about their geneology? 
	- Publications: Do you need a publication at Publication X, Y, or Z to be hired at University A, B, or C? (see python package "Scholarly")
	- Terminal Nodes: Predict whether someone will become a professor or not




- Geneology
	- Students and advisors select each other. So I would expect that a student's research area would be similar to their academic great-grandfather's research. So to stick to this geneology analogy... how much does academic DNA get passed down? 
	- Why is this interesting...
