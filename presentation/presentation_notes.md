## Notes

### Proposal

#### Description

- does fake news move through social networks in regular pathways, and can we identify the critical waypoints in those paths? 

- how do people move around a city in taxis and how does that change over the course of a day (e.g. morning and evening rush hours)? 

- how do people migrate from country to country and how does that change over the course of years and decades? 

All of these questions and many more can be explored with the use of graphs, which elevate and allow for the study of the relationships between entities.  

Learn how to make a quick and easy graph in Python using the [NetworkX package](https://networkx.github.io/), analyze and visualize it all within a Jupyter notebook. Iâ€™ll talk about how graphs can provided neat solutions in situations where standard SQL techniques fail. Plus we will take a look at other graph platforms such as Neo4J and Spark GraphX and compare.

#### Outline

- what is a graph
    - nodes and relationships 
- why use a graph 
    - entity resolution
    - community detection
    - flow analysis 
    - incorporate disparate datasets 
- make a graph in NetworkX 
- analyze the graph
    - connected components
- visualize the graph
   - static, e.g. graphviz
   - interactive, e.g. D3 
- other graph packages, databases and libraries 
    - Neo4J 
    - Spark GraphX 

#### Audience takeaways
- what a graph is 
- particular challenges and scenarios that graph-based analysis can help address 
- how to make a graph with NetworkX 
- how to find the connected components in the graph 
- how to visualize the graph both statically and interactively 
- other graph packages, better suited to very large graphs
